// real world problems - like net banking, replacing real world with virtual world we need data
// and also we need processing on data
// data may be from user and you will do something to that data
// we may also store data after processing - we need database(a permanent storage- replace a value but it is stored there)

// receive data - process -> temporary purpose(variables)

// imagine variable as an image, text, integer, video that is data right

// maybe we can give it a name, one more box

// variable can have a name to access the value inside it 

// strongly typed language (java) - tell me what kind of data type you want , for example i want integer its int a = 9; i have created integer a, and value inside it is 9
