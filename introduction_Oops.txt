Java is Object oriented programming language
if i am using pen that is an object everything around us is object.
every object has two things -> does somethings -> and knows somethings
and when i am saying that has something -> that are properties,
and what does it do -> e.g. with pen write something...

whatever project you are making you will be having something 
you have to treat everything as object.

for example add two numbers 

looks at this example

public class Demo{
    public static void main(String a[]){

    }
}

in order to create an object in java we need to create a class first 
// object -> class
// who creates objects in real life 
company-> makes pen -> 
company->has prototype (or a design or blueprint) -> to make a pen-> that is class in real life 

here we create a class and give it to jvm and we get object
lets move to code now 
this was introduction.
