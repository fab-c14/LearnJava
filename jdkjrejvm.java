// let us undrestand what is happening behind the scenes
// compile java code -> tool -> JDK (Java Development Kit)
// java code->complie->bytecode

// jvm - java virtual machine -> machine which runs your code.
// when you want to run bytecode you need a space -> that is jvm. (where we execute our code)

// behind the scenes jvm runs code
// your code is dependent on some external code
// 

// on top of jvm we have jre - java runtime environment 
// in jre we have all external files which we need to have while running code

// jvm is a part of jre and on top of jre we have JDK.


// sometimes we get error there is no .net file or java something ...
